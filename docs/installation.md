## For Contributors

### Build from Source Code

#### Step One: Install Carthage

To build this app, you will need to have the latest version of Xcode and
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) installed.

The simplest way to install Carthage is to use Homebrew.

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

You can also install Carthage with the installer package, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).

#### Step Two (Optional): Update dependencies

All the required binaries have been compiled and uploaded to the repository, so
you shouldn't need to do this. But if something doesn't work out, you might want
to try updating the dependencies.

```sh
$ carthage update --platform iOS
```

#### Step Three: Modify Project Settings

This repository contains the code used for distribution. To build and sign the app,
you will need to modify the app's Bundle Identifier, Teams, and Capabilities.

![Modify Xcode Project Settings](../Misc/Media/modify_proj.gif)

1. Navigate to the `NineAnimator` project file.
2. Under the `General` tab, change part of the `Bundle Identifier` to any
    aphanumeric characters without whitespaces.
3. Then navigate to the `Signing & Capabilities` tab. Select your team in the
    `Teams` drawer. If Xcode prompts you for the signing options, choose the one that
    let Xcode automatically manages signing.
4. Scroll down in the `Signing & Capabilities` tab. Remove the associated
    domains capability.

When contributing, do not include your team identifier.

#### Step Four: Build the app with Xcode

You won't need any Apple Developer membership to build and install this app.
Open this project in Xcode, connect your phone to the computer, select your
device, and click the run button on the top left corner.
