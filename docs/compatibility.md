## Device Compatibility

NineAnimator is compatible with devices running iOS 11.2 or later. This
includes iPhones and iPads.

The app is tested on the following devices running the latest operating
systems:

- iPhone Xs Max
- iPhone 11
- iPad 9.7-inch (2018)
- iPad Pro 11-inch (2018)

### UIKit for Mac (a.k.a. Project Catalyst) Support

NineAnimator does not officially support Project Catalyst at the moment.
However, we do plan on enabling this feature as soon as the SDK matures
and stabilizes.

In the mean time, you are welcomed to experiment with Project Catalyst
by yourself. And feel free to discuss your experiences on our Discord
channels (be sure to @marcuszhou -- I am super interested to see this
work as well).
